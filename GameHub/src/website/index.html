		<p> "My name is Zachary Jones. I am a Junior at NCSU. I am
			double majoring in Math and Computer Science. I choose
			Math because I have loved math ever since I started
			alegbra in elementary school. I then added on computer
			science because I love programming as well as solving
			problems with algorithms and the tools given to me."

		<p> "My favorite hobby would have to be bike riding. I started
			bike riding with my cousin when I was in middle school
			and him ad I are still riding bikes now. Biking allows
			you to have the wind in your hair without having to
			pay for gas. It also was a great way for him and I to
			get in shape. Biking has also promoted me to travel around
			the NCSU campus very quickly when going to clases."
